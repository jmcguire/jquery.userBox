Overview
--------

A jQuery UI plugin that creates a nice drag-and-drop interface for an
online email client. You can drag users from the userlist over to the various
email input fields, i.e. To, CC, BCC.


Usage
-----

var data = [
    {text: "Adam Adamson", id: "adam@test.com"},
    {text: "Betsy Boop",   id: "betsy@test.com"},
    {text: "Carl Cuffed",  id: "carl@test.com"},
];

$('.email_input').userBox(data, {
    dragbox: '#userlist'
});


Parameters
----------

dragbox

 - The #id of the block-level element that will be hold the user listing.  This
   is the only required parameter.

separator

 - All input data is separated with this field.  Default is "," (a comma).

data_id_field

 - The fieldname of the ID value in the data hash.  This is the data that is
   passed through with the form submission.  Default is "id".

data_text_field

 - The fieldname of the text value in the data hash.  This is the data that is
   displayed to the user.  Default is "text".

title

 - A title that is displayed above the dragbox.  If it's set to false, then it
   won't display.  You can style it with ".ub-title", I'd recommend setting the color and background-color at a minimum.  Default is false.

dbl_click

 - If you double-click an item in the userbox, it will automaticaly go to the
   #field specified here.  This field *must* match up to a field you called the userbox with, otherwise a double click will cause an item to disappear.  By default this will automatically be set to the first input field in the userbox function call.

css_tricks

 - userbox does a few cute tricks within the code to make things to make things
   fit and look good (i.e. with padding, height, and width). Setting this to
   false will turn all those tricks off, letting you style everything manually
   through CSS. Default is true.


Misc Notes
-------------

Minimum jQuery versions:

    - jQuery    1.4.0
    - jQuery UI 1.7.0

(Note: This program could be modifed for earlier jQuery versions, just redo the
first() and last() calls.)
