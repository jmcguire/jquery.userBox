VERY LONG TERM KNOWN ERRORS:

  * add ipad-friendly touch events.

  * if the user manually enters "ub-index-#" (where # is some number) into the
    text box, we'll get a copy of the item from the userbox with that id.

  * "ub-index-#" cannot be ever entered manually. adjust with an option?
    "index_name_nudge"? better: recode to not confuse indicies and manual entries?

  * if the user manually enters text that also exists in the userbox, should we
    figure this out, take it out of the userbox and insert that one instead?
    should we use the display_name?

  * quotation marks in the data.id will screw us up. XSS problem?

  * html in the data.text with screw us up. XSS problem?

  * should allow multiple userboxes. work around all IDs. index_name_nudge
    again? has to be a better option, lists?

  * the data should be retrievable via a json call

  * add an item to an input, press the delete key once to active the
    ub-item-active, now double-click an item in the userbox. the previously
    activated item is still active, but it shouldn't be.
